_Reupload February 14, 2024, for some commit errors after pushing the updated version on the old repo._

### This game was made with the help of Zuitt Coding Workshop last January 20 & 21, 2024 as part of their free JavaScript Game Development Workshop. 
### In 2048 game, the player must combine tiles containing the same numbers until they reach the number 2048. The tiles can contain only integer values starting from 2, and that are a power of two, like 2, 4, 8, 16, 32, and so on (Mateush, 2021 - FreeCodeCamp).
